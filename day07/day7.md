# Day 7: The Treachery of Whales

### Part 1
A simple, brute-force solution. The whole thing is just a bunch of calls to [reduce\(\)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) and a couple of regular for loops. 

### Part 2
Another brute-force solution. I briefly thought about some math-based optimizations for part 2, but the naive solution ended up running instantly so I didn't bother.
