# Solutions to Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the (ongoing) 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

## Setup
1. Install NodeJS 16 or later (if unsure, select the LTS version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)).
2. Clone this repository to a folder.
3. Open a terminal / command prompt and run `npm install`.

## Running
* Through the command line:
  * Run all solutions: `npm run all`.
  * Run a specific day: `npm run dayD` where D is a day number starting from 1.
  * Run a specific part: `npm run dayD:partP` where D is a day number and P is 1 or 2.
  * Run a challenge: `npm run dayD:challenge:C` where D is a day number and C is a challenge number.
* Through WebStorm IDE:
  * Select the desired day and part from the "run" menu at the top right, then press the green "play" button.
