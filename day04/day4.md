# Day 4: Giant Squid

### Part 1
Another simple solution - just a whole bunch of loops. Oh, and about an hour of my life lost because I can't read. DiAgOnAls DoN't CoUnt.

_Pro tip: don't mutate an array that you're actively looping through. It ends... badly. And JS doesn't throw a ConcurrentModificationException like many other languages._

### Part 2
Almost exactly the same as part 1, I just keep going until all boards have won.
